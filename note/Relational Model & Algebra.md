# 0. Relational Model & Algebra
## 0.1 Data Models
- **Data Model**: a collection of concepts for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and constraints.
- **Relational Model**: a data model based on first-order predicate logic, modeling data as relations (tables).
- **Shema**: a description of a data model, specifying the data structure and constraints.
## 0.2 Relational Model
- **Relation**: a table of data, with each row representing an entity and each column representing an attribute.
- **Tuple**: a row in a relation, representing an entity. Each tuple has the same number of attributes.
- **Attribute**: a column in a relation, representing a property of an entity.
- **Domain**: the set of possible values for an attribute.
- **Relation Schema**: the name of a relation and the set of attributes it contains.
- **Relation Instance**: a set of tuples that conform to a relation schema.
- **Key**: a set of attributes that uniquely identify a tuple in a relation.
- **Primary Key**: a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple in a relation.
- **Foreign Key**: a set of attributes that refer to the primary key of another relation.
