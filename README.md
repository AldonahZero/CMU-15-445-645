# CMU 15-445/645: Database Systems Course

This repository is a personal workspace for my journey through Carnegie Mellon University's course **15-445/645 - Database Systems**. The course focuses on the principles and practices of modern database systems, covering foundational topics such as storage, indexing, query optimization, concurrency control, and recovery.

## About This Repository

- **Course Materials**: Includes notes, code snippets, and summaries of key lectures and readings.
- **Assignments**: My implementations of various projects and assignments, such as buffer pool management, B+ trees, and transaction management.
